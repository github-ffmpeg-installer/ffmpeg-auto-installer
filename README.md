# ffmpeg-auto-installer

The goal of this repository is to provide a single command 
that can be run on windows computers
which will install ffmpeg and add it to the %PATH%
so that ffmpeg may be invoked from anywhere

There will also be simple batch files that perform simple tasks
without having to climb the everest which is ffmpeg's documentation pile
